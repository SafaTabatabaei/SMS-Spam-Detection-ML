# SMS-Spam-Detection-ML
Developed an efficient ML model to accurately classify SMS messages as "SPAM" or "HAM" (not spam). Leveraging NLP techniques for text processing and feature engineering 
# ðŸ“§ SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning (NLP)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a robust Machine Learning model to classify SMS messages as either "Spam" or "Ham" (legitimate message). It demonstrates an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline, from raw text data to a deployed classification model.

## âœ¨ Key Features & Technologies

-   *Natural Language Processing (NLP):* Comprehensive text preprocessing including cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization (if applied).
-   *Text Vectorization:* Transforming text into numerical features using techniques like *TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)* or *CountVectorizer*.
-   *Machine Learning Models:* Implementation and comparison of various classification algorithms, such as:
    -   *Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB):* Often a strong baseline for text classification due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
    -   *Support Vector Machines (SVC):* Powerful algorithm for high-dimensional data.
    -   *Logistic Regression / RandomForest Classifier (Optional, if explored)*
-   *Model Evaluation:* Rigorous assessment of model performance using key metrics like:
    -   Accuracy
    -   Precision, Recall, F1-Score
    -   Confusion Matrix
-   *Data Visualization:* Illustrating insights from data and model performance.

*Technologies Used:*
Python | Pandas | Numpy | Scikit-learn | NLTK | Matplotlib | Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

This project utilizes the *SMS Spam Collection Dataset*, which comprises over 5,000 legitimate (ham) and spam SMS messages.
